# C Data Structures

This repository contains my implementations for several data structures in C. My goal was to make generic, efficient, and easy-to-use functions. Each data structure has functions to handle common applications (insertion, deletion, searching, etc) with comments for documentation. 

### Data structures implemented:
* Linked lists (in progress)
* Binary Trees (planned)
* Heaps (planned)
* Stacks (planned)
* Queues (planned)
* Graphs (planned)
